### Making the Eat-da-burger app. 

Well this was a super tough HW. The first half of getting the DB connected and setting up the ORM was nice I felt confident in what I was writing.
Then came the model and the controllers this got me stumped for hours just trying to figure out where to start. I used the cat exercise as a template and that was really the only way I could figure it out. Im still feeling fuzzy with how models work and how to wright the controller. adding errors or the routes are still tough. Glad its finished tho.

Heroku app with a database is not fun to set up so this link might not work.
