### Making the Eat-da-burger app. 

Well this was a super tough HW. The first half of getting the DB connected and setting up the ORM was nice I felt confident in what I was writing.
Then came the model and the controllers this got me stumped for hours just trying to figure out where to start. I used the cat exercise as a template and that was really the only way I could figure it out. Im still feeling fuzzy with how models work and how to wright the controller. adding errors or the routes are still tough. Glad its finished tho.
